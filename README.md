 We are using this tutorial: https://gamedevacademy.org/create-a-basic-multiplayer-game-in-phaser-3-with-socket-io-part-1/

 Phaser3 with sockets.io

Run node server.js
Access simple game on localhost:8081. Open two windows to test
multiplayer functionality, and use the arrow
keys to move ships around.

Small modifications were made in the server.js file compared to the
tutorial, because the tutorial does not work out-of-the-box anymore.
