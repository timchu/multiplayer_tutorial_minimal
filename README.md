 We are using this tutorial: https://gamedevacademy.org/create-a-basic-multiplayer-game-in-phaser-3-with-socket-io-part-1/  to create a simple multiplayer game with trivial movement functionality.

Requires an NPM and node installation.

Run:
npm i
npm i express
npm i http
npm i jsdom
npm i socket.io
npm i datauri

Run node server.js
Access simple game on localhost:8081. Open two windows to test
multiplayer functionality, and use the arrow
keys to move ships around.

Small modifications were made in the server.js file compared to the
tutorial, because the tutorial does not work out-of-the-box anymore.
